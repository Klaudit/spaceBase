<h2 id="spacebase-is-a-boilerplate">spaceBase is a boilerplate</h2>
<p>Unlike many other SCSS libraries, spaceBase is not intended to be included once and never touched. The goal with spaceBase is a boilerplate layer that you can build on, modify, tweak, and tailor to your needs.</p>
<p>spaceBase is meant to be copied into your project for further modifications. The SCSS files in <code>scss/base/</code> are usually not modified much, but the files in <code>scss/ui/</code> are meant to be completely tailored to your project.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-spacebase">Setting Up spaceBase</h2>
<p>After you download the latest spaceBase ZIP from the repo, you&#39;ll unzip it and copy folders into your own project.</p>
<h3 id="stylesheets">Stylesheets</h3>
<p>Copy the following to your project:</p>
<pre><code>fonts/
images/
scss/
.editorconfig
</code></pre><p>spaceBase is built with Sass and Compass, so you&#39;ll need a Sass compiler and the Compass gem. A Compass <code>config.rb</code> is included in the spaceBase folder you can use for reference.</p>
<p>Installing Ruby, Sass, and Compass is outside the scope of this document.</p>
<p>spaceBase works well with static web tools like Middleman or Jekyll, or simple build tools (like a simple Gruntfile).</p>
<p>Your editor should be setup with an EditorConfig plugin, so that certain basic code style standards are enforced automatically. See <a href="http://editorconfig.org/#download">http://editorconfig.org/#download</a> and install the plugin for your editor of choice.</p>
<p>You can remove <code>scss/README.md</code>.</p>
<h3 id="javascripts">JavaScripts</h3>
<p>spaceBase has some opinions on JavaScript setup. You can copy the starter folder <code>javascripts/</code> if you like.</p>
